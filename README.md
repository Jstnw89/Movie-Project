# Fresh Tomatoes Website:

The Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailers website is a website project writing html in conjunction with python to create a website. This website allows users to see the poster art of various new release movies and quick access to their respective trailers.  It pulls in the images, urls, and data using the Movie() class from Movie.py to create instances of movies inside of media.py which can then be fed into the fresh_tomatoes.html and .py files.
